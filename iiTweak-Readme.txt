+) Section 1. About
===================
  iiTweak is a small collection of tweaks for the Infinity Engine games - all games are catered for from a single tweak-pack, and *only tweaks which will affect the target game will be offered for installation*. The tweaks have not been extensively tested, but they all should work. Bear in mind that some of the tweaks could radically alter the game, possibly ruining game-balance if used irresponibly. If you dont like a tweak, simply uninstall it.

+) Section 2. (un)Installation
==============================
  To install, simply unzip the archive, named in the form iiTweak(xx).zip [where (xx) represents the release version], to the main game directory (i.e. where you installed BG1,BG2,IWD1 or IWD2), run the  Setup-iiTweak.exe file, and follow the prompts.

  To uninstall, simply run the Setup-iiTweak.exe file and follow the prompts (choosing the Uninstall option).

+) Section 3. Components
========================

A) No Exclusion Schools
      This component will remove the exclusion schools from the game. This means that all mages will be able to cast all spells (e.g. Edwin will be able to learn and cast spells from the Divination school).

B) No Item Exclusion
      This component removes the restriction of wearing similar items (e.g. with this component it is possible to wear two Rings of Protection +1).

C) Equal Starting Gold
      This component gives all classes an equal chance of starting the game with the same amount of gold. The amount of gold given to the player is dictated bythe formula (5d4 +1) *10.

D) Raise Dead cost
      This component alters the cost of the "Raise Dead" spell at Temples. The cost of raising someone is now 1000 * the dead characters level (e.g. 1000gp for a level 1 character and 40,000gp for a level 40 character).

E) No Class Requirements
      This component removes the class stat requirements (e.g. Bards required 12 DEX, 13 INT and 15 CHA).

F) No Class Modifiers [BG2/IWD2]
      This component removes the stat modifiers gained for being a particular class (e.g. Beastmasters suffered -2 STR and -2 CON).

G) No Resultant Dual-Class Requirements
      This component removes the stat requirements from the target class of a dual-class.

H) No Initial Dual-Class Requirements
      This component removes the stat requirements from the current class of a dual-class.

I) No Racial Advantage Modifiers
      This component removes the stat modifiers for being a particular class (e.g. Half-Orc stats were modofied as STR +1, CON +1, INT -2)

J) No Racial Requirements
      This component removes the stat requirements for being a particular race (e.g. Halflings required STR 7, DEX 7 CON 10 INT 6 WIS 3 CHA 3).

K) No Class Alignment Restrictions
      This component removes class alignment restrictions.

L) 0 XP Task Awards - Lock Picking [BG2]
      This component will set the XP thieves gain for picking locks to 0.

M) 0 XP Task Awards - Disarm Traps [BG2]
      This component will set the XP thieves gain for disarming traps to 0.

N) 0 XP Task Awards - Learn Spells [BG2]
      This component will set the XP mages gain for scribing scrolls to 0.

O) Restored Maze Spell [BG2]
      The game manual, and the in-game description of the effects of the Maze spell differ from the rules (possibly) implemented by the game. This component restores the Maze spell to use the settings referred to by the description and manual.

P) No Item Stat Requirements
      This component removes the stat requirements from all items (e.g. Bastard Swords required 11 Strength).

Q) Fully Explored Areas
      This component reveals areas as soon as the Player enters them. Note that the area is explored, but the Fog Of War remains.

+) Section 4. Known Issues
==========================
It is unknown if/how the tweaks will affect Planescape: Torment.

If you find any errors, please let me know immediately, specifying as much as you can about your problem.
